# MessageLogger-plugin

Logs all [/] commands executed and messages sent on the server. 
It's logged in a .txt file. 
Tried my best to optimize it and it seems to run smoothly. You should clear the file every now and then if you don't need the logs. If you want a players logs saved, just download the logged .txt file.
For now I haven't seen any bugs, message me on discord if you find any : alfred146#7912
